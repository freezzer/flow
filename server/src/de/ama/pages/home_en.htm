   <h3> This Website is a psychological Experiment</h3>
</p>
<p>
   it try's to find out, wether anybody can make a realistic assessment of some one else, only by
   looking at a photograph of this person.</p>
<p>
    it's not a picture portal for voting pictures. <br>
    the categories you vote on, are not like  "is the picture nice", "is a person nice", or "is a person sexy".
</p>
<p>
    the Question is, <br>
    can a personality be seen only by a small photo? <br>
    and do other see your person right by this photo ?

</p>
<p>
    At the other hand you can use this free service for testing a passport-picture and its impression to others.
    You can verify, wether your self-assessment corresponds to the apraisals of others.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3> How does it work </h3>
<p>
 you need an acount (name and password). than you can do assessments to the available photographies.
 if you want to upload a picture , you will be requested to do an apraisal of another photography. <br> <br>

 thats it.<br>
 later on you can look if other persons have done a apraisals to your photo.
